  But after he had considered this</a>, an angel of the Lord
  appeared to him in a dream and said,
  ""<strong>Joseph son of <u>David</u></strong>, do not be afraid to take Mary
  home as your wife, because what is conceived in her
  is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son,
  and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will
  save his people from their sins.‚Äù</p>
